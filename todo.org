You can use git add --patch 'filename' (or -p for short), and git will begin to break down your file into what it thinks are sensible "hunks" (portions of the file). It will then prompt you with this question:

Stage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,/,j,J,g,s,e,?]?

Here is a description of each option:

    y stage this hunk for the next commit
    n do not stage this hunk for the next commit
    q quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining hunks
    a stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
    d do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the file
    g select a hunk to go to
    / search for a hunk matching the given regex
    j leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk
    J leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk
    k leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk
    K leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk
    s split the current hunk into smaller hunks
    e manually edit the current hunk
    ? print hunk help

If the file is not in the repository yet, you can first do git add -N 'filename'. Afterwards you can go on with git add -p 'filename'.

Afterwards, you can use:

    git diff --staged to check that you staged the correct changes
    git reset -p to unstage mistakenly added hunks
    git commit -v to view your commit while you edit the commit message.

Note this is far different than the git format-patch command, whose purpose is to parse commit data into a .patch files.

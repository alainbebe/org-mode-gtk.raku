"org-mode-gtk.raku" is yet another todo-list based on Org-mode.
I try to do that with raku et grammar for parsing the todo.org.
And I use GTK::Simple for the interaction.
And it's my first github projet.

V0.1 is a very simple program, juste add and remove tasks "* test" or sub-task "** try" in Org-mode.
